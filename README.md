# Sorting Visualizer

This Sorting Visualizer is a web application built using React.js that allows users to generate an array of random numbers and visualize various sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Bubble Sort.

## Features

- Generate a random array of numbers within a specified range.
- Visualize sorting algorithms in real-time.
- Vary the number of bars, minimum and maximum range, and animation speed for customization.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pragyakashyap/sorting-visualizer.git
```

```

## Usage

1. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5173 to access the Sorting Visualizer.

3. Use the Generate new array button to generate a new array, select a sorting algorithm, and visualize the sorting process.

## Algorithms

### Merge Sort

- Description: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- Complexity: O(n log n)

### Quick Sort

- Description: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.
- Complexity: O(n log n) average case, O(n^2) worst case

### Bubble Sort

- Description: Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- Complexity: O(n^2)
